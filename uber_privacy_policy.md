For an app I'm building for myself, I have to provide a privacy policy for
data retrieved from the API.

I will not release any data from the Uber API without explicit and clear
consent of the user.

This does not affect the user's statutory rights. The user is able to stop
using the service at any time, and can remove any data from the service
using the appropriate database management commands.
